### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on an industrial telemetry system for factory lines. I mainly do this work in Elixir, and so far most
of the code is proprietary, so you'll mainly see quick & dirty hacks and experiments here unless you have the same private repository
access that I do.

[My Github Page](https://jasontrue.github.io/) has more narrative, a resume and so on.

I'm occasionally available for consulting on projects. Right now I'm probably most useful if you have periodic or short-term needs related to:

* Elixir OTP applications
* Phoenix/Liveview Applications
* Building out AWS Infrastructure
* Industrial PLC Protocols (Keyence, Melsec, ModbusTCP, EthernetIP/CIP)

I've got a lot of experience with web applications and internationalization. I've worked in both popular and esoteric technology stacks. My
work in recent years is very customer-facing and I like projects where I have direct customer impact and a fair amount of technical autonomy.
