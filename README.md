### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on an industrial telemetry system for factory lines. I mainly do this work in Elixir, and so far most
of the code is proprietary, so you'll mainly see quick & dirty hacks and experiments here unless you have the same private repository
access that I do.

[My Github Page](https://jasontrue.github.io/) has more narrative, a resume and so on.

### Build With IML
[IML Consulting](https://www.buildwithiml.com/)

My team is available for consulting projects. Our sweet spot is in extending our product to support continuous and discrete manufacturing applications
(factory telemetry data on any device, providing observability and operator guidance related to manufacturing setup and change processes, alerting systems,
custom reporting, plant floor audio communications solutions, video streaming and defect detection).
But we're a scrappy team with a diverse range of experiences and we've got the ability to delivery consumer- and line-of-business web and mobile applications,
backend web services, data pipelines, video and audio solutions, and more.

Want to migrate some/all of your tech stack from Rails or Python to Elixir? We can do that. Need to integrate live production data with ERP systems? We can do that.
Need mobile web development in Flutter/Dart? We can do that.

I'm managing our team while maintaining some software development responsibilities, but here are some of the things that I work on:
* Elixir OTP applications
* Phoenix/Liveview Applications
* Building out AWS Infrastructure
* Industrial PLC Protocols (Keyence, Melsec, ModbusTCP, EthernetIP/CIP)
* Industrial PoE camera frame and video capturing (primarily using LucidVision hardware so far)
* Building out audio and video pipelines for analysis and streaming

I've got a lot of experience with web applications and internationalization. I've worked in both popular and esoteric technology stacks. My
work in recent years is very customer-facing and I like projects where I have direct customer impact and a fair amount of technical autonomy.
