### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

For most of the last 5 years, I've been working on an industrial telemetry system for factory lines at [IndustrialML](https://www.industrialml.com/). I mainly did this work in Elixir, and most
of the code is proprietary, so you'll mainly see quick & dirty hacks and experiments here unless you have the same private repository
access that I do.

I'm currently looking for consulting or fulltime opportunities. I'm happy to help you doing fractional CTO work if you're at an early stage and mainly
need assistance with technical strategy or hiring. In addition, I'm interested in project-based or full time work doing things like:

* Taking ambiguous business objectives and turning them into a concrete technical strategy
* Building out and managing a hand-picked team of remote engineers
* Managing your team
* Building proof-of-concept applications
* Systems and application architecture
* Solving weird problems

[My Github Page](https://jasontrue.github.io/) has more narrative, a resume and so on.

Here are a few things I've done in the last 5 years:

* Elixir OTP applications
* Phoenix/Liveview Applications
* Building out AWS Infrastructure
* Industrial PLC Protocols (Keyence, Melsec, ModbusTCP, EthernetIP/CIP)
* Industrial PoE camera frame and video capturing (primarily using LucidVision hardware so far)
* Building out audio and video pipelines for analysis and streaming

I've got a lot of experience with web applications and internationalization. I've worked in both popular and esoteric technology stacks. My
work in recent years is very customer-facing and I like projects where I have direct customer impact and a fair amount of technical autonomy.
