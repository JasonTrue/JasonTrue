### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on an industrial telemetry system for factory lines. I mainly do this work in Elixir, and so far most
of the code is proprietary, so you'll mainly see quick & dirty hacks and experiments here unless you have the same private repository
access that I do.

[My Github Page](https://jasontrue.github.io/) has more narrative, a resume and so on.
